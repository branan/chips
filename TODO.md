This is not prioritized

* Generalize movement code to allow monsters to re-use it
* Redo world storage. The top/bot cells in the chips map format are
  actually treated as a tiny stack. We can just use a real stack and
  simplify tons of code.
* Bounds checking on the viewport
* Player inventory
* Interaction between players, monsters, the world, etc.
